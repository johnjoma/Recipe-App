        \n\n<li>12 chipolatas.</li>
        \n\n<li>200g pack smoked dry-cured bacon lardons.</li>
      \n\n<li>4 tbsp sunflower oil.</li>
       \n\n<li>680g bottle passata.</li>
      \n\n<li>1 tbsp sweet smoked paprika.</li>
       \n\n<li>3 tbsp tomato purée.</li>
       \n\n<li>1 tbsp brown sugar.</li>
       \n\n<li>100g brown sauce.</li>
       \n\n<li>3 x 400g cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed.</li>
       \n\n<li>6 eggs.</li>
        \n\n<li>piles of hot buttered toast, to serve.</li>

    </string>


    <string name="Step1">Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Toss the chipolatas, bacon lardons and 1 tbsp of the oil together in a large roasting tin.
                             Roast for 20-30 mins until everything is turning brown and crisp – you may want to tip off any liquid and stir it halfway.
                             Use a fish slice to scrape up any stuck bits.</string>
    <string name="Step2">Whisk together the passata, paprika, tomato purée, sugar, brown sauce,
                             250ml water,a little salt and lots of pepper. Stir into the tin with the beans.
                             Can be made 1 day ahead – cool first, tip into a plastic container, then chill.</string>
    <string name="Step3">Put the tin back in the oven and bake for another 20 mins until thickened and bubbling
                           (add another 10 mins if cooking from chilled).</string>
    <string name="Step4">Turn off the oven but leave the tin in to keep warm while you fry the eggs.
                            Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan, crack in the eggs and fry them to your liking.
                            Serve the fried eggs with the sausage bake and plenty of hot buttered toast.</string>
